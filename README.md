# discsCatalog
A simple discs catalog using the MEAN stack and Elasticsearch


# Instructions to run

You should have Node.js, MongoDB and Elasticseach installed. After all being installed, start the MongoDB server,
then the Elasticsearch server. 

From the root folder run 'npm install' to install the dependencies. 

Finally, to run the node server, just run 'npm start' or 'node path/to/bin/www', and your app will be up and running!


The versions tested by me are: MongoDB v3.2.4, Elasticsearch v2.3.1, Node.js v4.4.1
